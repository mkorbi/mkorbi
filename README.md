### Hey, I'm Max

At day I build cloud native solutions on/with Kubernetes and multi-/hybrid cloud environments, from the solution architecture of a system to the infrastructure of the platform. At night I support open source projects where possible, currently as part of the Kubernetes Release Team, writing blogs and give talks about the cloud native and open source universe. 

Because we love what we do we created a company Liquid Reply (within the Reply consulting network) and we are hiring! -> [Liquid Reply GitHub](https://github.com/Liquid-Reply/we-are-hiring)

- 🥇 2022 Goals
    - 💻 Make more people contribute to Open Source projects
    - ⛅️ Bring Cloud Native to the IT organizations
    - 🚣‍♀️ Do some sport! (more a reminder to myself)
- 👨‍🎨 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
